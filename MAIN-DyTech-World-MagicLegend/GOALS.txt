Here are the goals for this module:

- Random Ruin generation in the world. (make simple graphics (aka text graphics) real graphics will be done after its done)
- Random loot in the world. This is also part of the ruin generation. Some items will be filled with loot. (Look in the Base game's Sandbox scenario control.lua to see how to spawn loot into an entity)
- Spaceship generation on start of the game (only at start, so not loading a new save game)
- Loot in the spaceship, and when mining the spaceship you get some items as well.
- It must be easily configurable with a few tweak at the top of the control.lua.
- MUST be MP compatible.
- Must be optimized. (with debug screen active, use less then 0.2 script-update)

Some tips:
- DyTech Core holds a lot of info which can be used. Ask me for a transfer from Core to World if needed (but try to do it yourself if possible).
- The loot MUST be Factorio loot only. NOT DYTECH items! its not dependent on DyTech-Core.
- You can either use the tree type or the chest type for the ruins :P
