Default Copper Ore:
First Peak (Random Or Empty)

Second Peak: (Main copper generation)

Third Peak: (Starting area boost)

Fourth Peak: (Starting area increasing boost)
CODE: SELECT ALL

Fifth peak (Avoid Iron):
CODE: SELECT ALL

noise_layer = "iron-ore", -- Noise layer determines what to avoid
noise_octaves_difference = -2.3, -- Increased effect further from start to match irons own increase
